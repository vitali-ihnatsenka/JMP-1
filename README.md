# JMP-1

A robotic rover was landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars to find alians scrap.
Marses plateau is a square with edges in 10x10 meters
A rover's and scraps positions are represented by a combination of an x and y co-ordinates.
In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string: (x,y) where x and y is coordinate.
Rover trying to move to new coordinate step by step by one meter. For example, rover position is (0,0), new position is (3,2) - rover will made five steps until end this comand.
if his position equal scrap position - it found scrap and mission is succesful.
If rover didn't found scrap - NASA operator put new command.
You can implement any logic of rover moving.
Use DRY, KISS and SOLID principles.
